A Linux device driver for 7-segment displays

## How to build as an out-of-tree module

Prepare the kernel sources for compilation (only needed once)
```
# Source your target machine SDK
$ source /path/to/sdk/environment-setup

# Prepare kernel sources
$ cd /path/to/sdk/sysroots/cortexa7/usr/src/kernel
$ make scripts
$ make prepare
```

> [!NOTE]
> This step only needs to be executed once.

> [!NOTE]
> The SDK is usually provided by whoever maintains the distro you are using in your target machine to enable cross-compilation and cross-debugging.

> [!TIP]
> When using Yocto to build your own images, an SDK can be generated by ['bitbake <image-name> -c populate_sdk'](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/dev/sdk-manual/appendix-obtain.html)


Compile the sources of this repo
```
# If not done before or changed shells

$ export KERNEL_SRC=/path/to/sdk/sysroots/cortexa7/usr/src/kernel
